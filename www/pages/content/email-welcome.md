Welcome to TaskBot,

TaskBot is now syncing your GMail and Google Tasks. Changes in GMail are synced in real time, while those in Google Tasks sync every 10 minutes.

You can manually trigger a Google Tasks -\> GMail sync by adding the '!T/Sync GTasks' label to any email or via a link on your account page.

#### What steps do I need to take to start using TaskBot?

**TaskBot** configures itself automatically, this includes:

* Labels
* Colors
* **Google Tasks** lists

Optional (but recommended) steps the user has to perform manually are:

1.  [Enabling Multi Inbox](/faq#5)
2.  [Hiding the left sidebar](/faq#5)
3.  [Enabling the keyboard shortcuts](/faq#5)

#### How to configure Multi Inbox?

Enable Multi Inbox:

1.  [**GMail** Settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/general)
2.  [_"Advanced"_ Tab](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labs)
3.  Enable "Multiple Inboxes"
4.  [_"Multiple Inboxes"_ Tab](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/lighttlist)
5.  Set _"Below the inbox"_

Configure "Current searches" as follows:

* **Next** `(label:!s-next-action -label:s-finished -label:!s-expired -label:!s-pending) OR (label:!s-pending AND label:unread)`
* **Actions** `label:!s-action -label:!s-next-action -label:!s-finished -label:!s-expired`
* **Next** `( label:drafts OR label:!s-pending ) -label:!s-expired`
* **GTD** `label:!s-action OR label:!s-next-action OR label:!s-pending OR label:!s-finished OR label:!s-some-day`
* **Sent** `label:sent -label:chats`

After performing all the steps, save the changes.

#### How to hide the left GMail sidebar?

Save some space by hiding the left sidebar in **GMail**. You can always access it by hovering with the cursor or you can jump to labels by using [keyboard shortcuts](/faq/#5).

To hide the the left sidebar, click the top-right hamburger icon â˜°.

#### Will TaskBot read my emails?

**TaskBot** will not read the contents of your emails, although it will read the subjects and labels assigned to them. Details about accessed and stored data can be found in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).

#### Can I share a Google Tasks list with someone?

Not at the moment, but we're working on it! Soon you'll be able to share a custom list in **Google Tasks** with another **TaskBot** user, without using any dedicated UI. Tasks from that list will still be able to have a status assigned to them, which will make them show up in one of the status lists. That way you can organize your **GTD** independently of the shared list.

#### How to manually trigger a Google Tasks sync?

Although changes from **GMail** are propagated to **Google Tasks** in real time, the other way around happens only once per 10 minutes (it's an API limitation).

To trigger a sync from **Google Tasks** to **GMail** any time you need it, add a <span class='label command'>!T/Sync GTasks</span> to **any email** (doesn't have to have any `!S/` label or any label for that matter). **TaskBot** will pick it up immediately, trigger the sync and remove the label. That's it.

#### Does TaskBot need my password?

No. You don't have to give **TaskBot** your password, simply because we're using **Google Cloud API**s, which have token-based authentication.
